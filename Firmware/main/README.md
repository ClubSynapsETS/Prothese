# GUIDE adding components
Since default Make component does not seem to work we have to specify path for included compenents.
In the main/component.mk file
    add the path to the source file directory in the COMPONENT_SRCDIRS section.

    add the path to the header file directory in the COMPONENT_ADD_INCLUDEDIRS section.
